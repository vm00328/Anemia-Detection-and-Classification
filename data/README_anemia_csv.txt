Anemia dataset containing attributes Gender, Hemoglobin, MCHC, MCV, MCH and Results. This dataset is used to predict if a patient is likely to suffer from anemia. Machine learning binary classifier algorithm to be used.

Gender: 0 - male, 1 - female

Hemoglobin: Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen to your body's organs and tissues and transports carbon dioxide from your organs and tissues back to your lungs

MCH: MCH is short for "mean corpuscular hemoglobin." It's the average amount in each of your red blood cells of a protein called hemoglobin, which carries oxygen around your body.

MCHC: MCHC stands for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. It's a measure of the average concentration of hemoglobin inside a single red blood cell.

MCV: MCV stands for mean corpuscular volume. An MCV blood test measures the average size of your red blood cells.

Results: 0- not anemic, 1-anemic
