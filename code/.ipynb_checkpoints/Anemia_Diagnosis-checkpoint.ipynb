    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Addressing dataset imbalance through SMOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about this in terms of baking a cake. Imagine you're trying to bake a cake (your predictive model) using a recipe (the learning algorithm) but your ingredients (the training data) aren't quite right. Let's say you have way too many eggs (the majority class) and not enough flour (the minority class).\n",
    "\n",
    "SMOTE is like a magical kitchen gadget that can generate more flour for you. It looks at the flour you already have (the minority class), and creates similar, but not identical, new flour (synthetic minority samples). Now, you have a better balance of eggs and flour. Awesome, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the catch: you also want to save a bit of the original eggs and flour (your test set) to make a tiny cupcake (to test your model), and you don't want to use the magic gadget on these. Why? Because the cupcake is like the unseen, real-world data you'll be dealing with. Using the gadget on it would be like pretending you have more diverse real-world data than you really do, and you might end up with a model that performs well on your synthetic data but is a total flop on real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in your ML baking adventure, use SMOTE after you've split your data into a training set and a test set. Apply SMOTE only to the training set, keeping your test set untouched and reflective of the real-world data distribution. This way, your 'cake' (model) will be more likely to perform well not only on your balanced training data but also on your untouched test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, ML is a lot like baking. You're constantly adjusting, balancing ingredients, and sometimes having to start from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Scaler**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use RobustScaler() if your data has outliers and you want a robust way to scale your features without being skewed by extreme values. RobustScaler() will scale the data using the median and IQR, making it less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Use MinMaxScaler() if your models benefit from having input features strictly within a defined range (especially neural networks), but be cautious of outliers. MinMaxScaler() will scale the data between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use StandardScaler() if you are working with models that assume normally distributed data and your features are relatively normally distributed without extreme outliers. StandardScaler() will center the data around 0 with a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Evaluation Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "***micro:***\n",
    "- Aggregates all TP, FP, FN across classes and calculates the metric globally. Treats every sample equally, making it suitable when you care about the overall performance on individual samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "***macro:***\n",
    "- Averages the metric for each class equally, regardless of how many samples are in each class. Useful when you care about all classes equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "***weighted:***\n",
    "- Like macro, but accounts for the number of samples in each class. It's good when you want to consider class imbalance while still evaluating each class individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Model Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, decision tree-based algorithms perform well on imbalanced datasets. Similarly bagging and boosting based techniques are good choices for imbalanced classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest: This ensemble method can handle imbalances through its inherent structure, and it can also be tuned to weigh classes differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Similar to Random Forest, GBMs can be adjusted with parameters like scale_pos_weight in XGBoost to give more weight to the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVMs can be effective for imbalanced datasets by using a cost-sensitive approach, where a higher penalty is assigned to misclassifying the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression can be adapted for imbalanced datasets by using class weights to penalize mistakes on the minority class more heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "- KNN can be effective, especially if you use distance weighting to give more importance to the minority class during classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Techniques to improve performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anomaly Detection Techniques: When the minority class is very small, treating it as an anomaly can lead to better performance. Anomaly detection problems consider the minority class(rare-events) as outliers and apply several approaches to detect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Loss function adjustments*** : put an additional cost every time the model misclassifies the minority class. \r\n",
    "Every model works in a different way and there is a different way to apply this trick to every model. Setting up this penalty cost value could be complex, you might need to try out multiple schemes and check what works best for your case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuning the hyperparameters of the gradient boosting models can be achieved using the \"Hyperopt\" libary.\n",
